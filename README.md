Develop the layout of the provided mockup using the learned methods of working with CSS, HTML, JS. Pay attention to the semantic tags when developing the HTML structure. When working with CSS positioning, use the learned methods at your discretion, combine them as needed. JS may be needed to handle events for opening the menu on tablet and mobile devices.

Design the menu layout for mobile devices (based on a mockup with a maximum width of 1024px) according to your discretion (for example, as we developed during the live coding session on the 9th lesson).
